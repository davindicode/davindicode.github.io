**Optimal spike coding**  
An interesting line of research that separate from the conventional rate coding perspective is explored in this talk. This framework is referred to as "optimal spike coding", named because each individual spike conveys information optimally according to a simple criterion. Interestingly, this framework allows one to "derive" leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics from a normative model, connecting higher level computational functions directly with aspects of single neuron dynamics! Presented at the Computational Neuroscience Journal Club in the Cambridge University Engineering Department.

**Non-spatial representations in the hippocampal formation**  
This talk discussed experimental and theoretical works on neural representations in the hippocampal formation that go beyond spatial navigation. Typical cells like place cells exhibit characteristic tuning to animal position, but recent works have found equally informative representations in non-spatial contexts, such as auditory tasks. Theoretical studies hypothesize a general inference framework implemented by such neural representations. Presented at the Computational Neuroscience Journal Club in the Cambridge University Engineering Department.

**Variability in neural discharge of place and grid cells**  
This talk discussed experimental and computational analysis of the excess irregularity in neural spiking activity seen in many cells in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. These regions contain cells involved in spatial navigation, and studying the statistical properties of their spiking activity is a key step to understanding biological navigation. Presented at the Computational Neuroscience Journal Club in the Cambridge University Engineering Department.

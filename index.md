Welcome to my website! Currently, I am a PhD student with [Máté Lengyel](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org/lengyel) in the 
[Computational and Biological Learning group](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org/) at the University of Cambridge, developing and applying state-of-the-art methods for neural data analysis with a focus on studying neural variability. I have also worked at Meta Reality Labs CTRL as a research scientist intern, building and researching [EMG neuromotor interfaces](https://venturebeat.com/ai/ctrl-labs-ceo-well-have-neural-interfaces-in-less-than-5-years/#:~:text=Founded%20in%202015%2C%20Ctrl%2Dlabs,Ctrl%2Dlabs%20in%20September%202019.). Before this, I completed the [Natural Sciences Tripos](https://www.natsci.tripos.cam.ac.uk/) specializing in computational and theoretical physics, with my thesis on synchronization in simplified models of cilia supervised by [Pietro Cicuta](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/cicuta).

My main interests lie in neuroscience, machine learning, and their intersection. In particular, I am excited about understanding and decoding big neural data, as well as potential computational functions in discrete spiking activity that go beyond analog neural firing rates. I also retain an active interest in physics, in particular in its interfaces with biology and machine learning. In addition, I have a keen interest in cell biology, with strong exposure to the subject prior to focussing on physics.

See my [CV](/docs/David_Liu_CV.pdf) for more details.

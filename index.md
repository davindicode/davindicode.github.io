Welcome to my website! Currently, I am a PhD student with [Prof Máté Lengyel](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org/lengyel) in the 
[Computational and Biological Learning group](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org/) at the University of Cambridge, working on 
developing and applying state-of-the-art statistical models for neural data analysis. Before this, I completed the [Natural Sciences Tripos](https://www.natsci.tripos.cam.ac.uk/) with specialization in computational and theoretical physics (integrated masters degree).

My main interests lie in neuroscience, machine learning, and their intersection. In particular, I am excited about understanding and decoding big neural data, as well as potential computational functions in discrete spiking activity that go beyond analog neural firing rates. I also retain an active interest in physics, in particular in its interfaces with biology and machine learning. In addition, I have a keen interest in cell biology, with strong exposure to the subject prior to focussing on physics.

See my [CV](/docs/David_Liu_CV.pdf) for more details.
